      "Types of Cancers\n",
      "There are several ways of dividing the cancers into various types.\n",
      "For instance on the basis of growth (Doubling time), organ of origin,\n",
      "morphological appearance under the microscope, molecular\n",
      "changes (which cannot be seen with the microscope), natural\n",
      "history (as known previously based on study of large populations)\n",
      "and anticipated response to therapy.\n",
      "Currently, cancers are typically divided into various types based\n",
      "on the organ or tissue of origin.\n",
      "Cancers that originate from the skin or mucosal lining are\n",
      "commonly classified as carcinomas. Those that arise from the\n",
      "connective tissue, bones or muscles are called sarcomas. And the\n",
      "ones that begin in the hematopoietic or lymphatic system are called\n",
      "leukemias-lymphomas. Thus, theese consist of three broad\n",
      "categories – carcinomas, sarcomas and leukemia-lymphomas.\n",
      "In addition the cancer can be further sub-divided based on the\n",
      "organ or tissue of origin. For instance whether the carcinomas start\n",
      "in the lung or breast can help divide them into Lung Carcinoma or\n",
      "Breast Carcinoma.\n",
      "Even among the organ specific cancers, it is possible to assign the\n",
      "proper category based on the subtype of origin of the malignant\n",
      "cell – in lung carcinoma, the tumor can be further divided into\n",
      "adenocarcinoma of lung or squamous cell carcinoma of the lung,\n",
      "and so on.\n",
      "The more detailed the classification of the type of cancer a patient\n",
      "has, the better is your doctor’s understanding and hence the better\n",
      "is your chance of getting the right treatment. This is the reason\n",
      "why your doctor may ask for a repeat biopsy, especially when\n",
      "there is some doubt.\n",
      "If the cancer is not identified and treated in time, it may spread to\n",
      "distant parts of the body. In such circumstances, the tumor cells in\n",
      "the new tumor (metastasis) will still retain the pattern and nature\n",
      "of the original cancer origin and hence will continue to be called\n",
      "by the name of the original (primary) tumor. For instance, if lung\n",
      "cancer has spread to the brain, the tumor in the brain will be\n",
      "called as metastatic lung cancer (and not brain cancer).\n",
